Synchronizing with your database
================================

Every time you launch an application from Materia designer, it first synchronize your database with the state of your application. If something differ, you will be notified and some automatic operation can be done to auto merge the application with the database.

There is 2 automatic operations available:

* Update the database from the application

* Update the application from the database

It can be used to import existing database. We advise during 0.x versions of Materia Designer to make a copy/dump of your existing database before using it to prevent potential data loss.
