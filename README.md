Materia is an easy-to-use backend to build all kinds of applications (mobile, web, gaming and more). Materia tooling manages the entire development cycle for building enterprise class backends (database relationships, database synchronization, API management, static file hosting, dockerization, deployment). Materia is made to be simple and powerful, as it has been since the beginning thought by developers for developers.
